[DEFORMING_HOOD]
NAME=MOTORHOOD          ; name of parenting node containing all meshes to deform
OFFSET_Y_MIDDLE=0.05    ; how high would it offset in the center at full damage
OFFSET_Y_END=0.01      ; how high would it offset at the far end at full damage
OFFSET_Z_END=0.03       ; how far would it offset at the far end
BULGING_EXTRA=0.2       ; increase to make shape go less triangly and more trapezoid-like
BULGING_EXPONENT=2.0    ; affects the curve of slopes around raised center
NOISE_Y_AMPLITUDE=-0.16 ; some simple vertical noise at the center
NOISE_Z_AMPLITUDE=0.2   ; and horizontal noise at the far end
NOISE_Y_FREQENCY=7.0    ; which adds
NOISE_Z_FREQENCY=7.0    ; some randomization
Z_FACTOR=2.5            ; how center is being found
Z_BIAS=0.0              ; with, if needed, manual offset
