First of all, of course, we’d first like to thank the Kunos developers for all of the effort they put into making AC such a great simulator and giving us an excellent basis for our work.

Made by:
- henter, Jackson Papageorge (mclarenf1papa/JPG_18) of IER Simulations, x4fab.

With help from:
- Blamer: great app for setting up track lights and more;
- Chr0m3: tyre wear triggering tyres blowing;
- leBluem: improvements for python apps, documentation;
- Levels: new chaser camera script;
- Peter Boese: incredible Weather FX implementation, Sol;
- Scott Shaw: amazing tyre damages textures;
- Silent: per-set textures for Tyres FX;
- Tsuka1427: invaluable help with core functionality of Custom Shaders Patch.

Using:

- GPU-accelerated particles based [on this article](https://wickedengine.net/2017/11/07/gpu-based-particle-simulation/) by turanszkij;
- Grass idea [from GRID](http://blog.codemasters.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rendering-Fields-of-Grass-using-DirectX11-in-GRID-Autosport.pdf) by Richard Kettlewell (Codemasters);
- Icons from [www.flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com/);
- Lighting algorithm based on [a great idea](https://worldoffries.wordpress.com/2015/02/19/simple-alternative-to-clustered-shading-for-thousands-of-lights/) by Luke Mamacos;
